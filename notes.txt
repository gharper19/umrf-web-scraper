When looking at a catalog task, underneath work notes there are activities.
    These represent all changes to the current task. Whats important here is state(open or closed) and whether its switched hands(assigned user)
 
Example Page(in BM): 
Go to My Requests in Sidebar
    > Click a Req num
    > Scroll down to requested items and click a req or rit num  
    > Scroll down to catalog tasks and click a task num
   
Problems:
- Close request connection? - on reddCrawl too
- Check if input boxes are loaded as a JavaScript Post-Load
    - Use implicit timed waits and try to do it, then figure out why explicit wont work
    - Try different by (e.g. selector, xpath, inner html, index in collection of same tags) 
        - Make use of bs4 to organize and understand html
        - Recall Aaron said some property of the tables in SN are different ea time
