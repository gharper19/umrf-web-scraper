# umrf-web-scraper

Accepts a url and then exports data to csv file

## TODO - Needed by Tues
- Complete Task documentation for Laura
- Decide on stack (Python or Js, Selenium or webkit for Js interaction, BeautifulSoup or lxml for html, Panda for exporting to xlsx, JavaFx for .exe wrapping)
- Deliberate on alternatives: recreate the DOM virtually then extract the data, make a chrome extension
