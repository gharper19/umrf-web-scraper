What's done?
    Scraper perfectly finishes loop for ServiceNow starting at the table of catalog task and iterating through the tasks until the button disappears. 
    Compatability changes for switch PDSM have been made but not tested. 
Distribution for testing is pending. Our options include: 
        
        - Packaging via pip, which requires we install Python and pip, followed by installing pip -r requirements.txt, on host. 
        This is the most efficent option for development as we can continue building and testing in VDI indefinitely. 
        However fedex would have to install python as well as the dependencies on VDI for us before we can begin.
        
        - Freezing the Distribution with its dependencies and a python interpretor. This will give us a packaged executable which can run without python installed on the host.
        This presents the issue of transfering the project distribution into the VDI, which will have to be done for each new distribution if any code needs changing.
            - I'm Currently working with this method and it seems there may be issues with including selenium in the installation
        
        - Copy code from dependencies into project files. 

## Dev Notes for Distribution
- We've got the table link, from there you can alter the filter further to active tasks, or even all tasks 
- Only prioritized task number, state, assigned_to, and all activity cards. I can still update descriptions and other details during indiviual page scrape
- line 250 may be a problem in EPDSM, it correctly cuts first 2 td of each row in table, but also cuts last 4 off the end, if this is important data it will be a problem - Easily solved by fixing fields section or just use indv page scrape
- Currently exports to csv, but with small set column widths. Can fix col widths(https://www.bing.com/search?q=cant+increase+column+size+in+excel+csv&PC=U316&FORM=CHROMN), but can also be changed to another file type if neccessary.
- fix file paths if needed
